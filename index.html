    <header>Polars: The High-Speed DataFrame Library</header>
    
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Polars is a powerful DataFrame library designed for high-speed data manipulation and analysis. It is built on the <b>Rust programming language</b>, providing a highly efficient alternative to traditional tools like Pandas. Due to its multi-threading capabilities and lazy evaluation, Polars significantly improves performance when handling large datasets.</p>

        <p><b>Why choose Polars?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Efficiently processes large datasets without high memory consumption.</li>
            <li>Leverages multi-threading for faster computations.</li>
            <li>Supports lazy execution for optimized query processing.</li>
            <li>Compatible with popular formats like CSV, JSON, and Parquet.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Installation & Setup</h2>
        <h3>Installing Polars in Python</h3>
        <p>To install the Polars library in a Python environment, run:</p>
        <pre><code>pip install polars</code></pre>
        <p>To include dependencies for handling multiple data formats, install:</p>
        <pre><code>pip install polars[all]</code></pre>

        <h3>Installing Polars in Rust</h3>
        <p>For Rust users, add Polars as a dependency in the <b>Cargo.toml</b> file:</p>
        <pre><code>[dependencies]
polars = "0.38.0"</code></pre>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <h3>1. High Performance</h3>
        <p>Polars is designed for speed, using Rust’s memory safety and concurrency features to outperform traditional libraries. Its efficient data structures and parallel execution model allow it to process massive datasets much faster than Pandas, making it ideal for real-time analytics, financial modeling, and machine learning workflows.</p>

        <h3>2. Lazy Execution</h3>
        <p>Instead of executing operations immediately, Polars builds a query plan and executes it only when needed. This lazy evaluation reduces unnecessary computations, optimizes query execution, and speeds up workflows, especially when working with large datasets, making it significantly more efficient than eager execution-based libraries like Pandas.</p>

        <h3>3. Multi-threading</h3>
        <p>Polars leverages Rust’s multi-threading capabilities, allowing computations to run in parallel across multiple CPU cores. This ensures that even complex operations, such as aggregations and joins, are executed efficiently. Unlike Pandas, which runs on a single thread, Polars automatically optimizes resource usage for faster data processing.</p>

        <h3>4. Memory Efficiency</h3>
        <p>Polars is optimized for handling large datasets without excessive memory usage. Its columnar data storage format ensures that only the necessary columns are loaded into memory, reducing overall footprint. This makes Polars a great choice for cloud-based applications and environments where memory is a constraint.</p>

        <h3>5. Heterogeneous Column Handling</h3>
        <p>Unlike many other DataFrame libraries, Polars efficiently manages heterogeneous columns, allowing different data types within the same DataFrame. It seamlessly supports operations on mixed-type data without performance degradation, making it particularly useful for handling real-world datasets that contain numeric, string, and categorical data together.</p>

        <h3>6. Wide File Format Support</h3>
        <p>Polars natively supports various data formats, including CSV, JSON, Parquet, and Arrow. This makes it highly versatile for data ingestion, whether from local storage, cloud services, or big data pipelines. With built-in read and write functionalities, it seamlessly integrates with modern data engineering workflows.</p>

        <h3>7. SQL-like Querying</h3>
        <p>With an intuitive API similar to SQL, Polars makes data manipulation easy for those familiar with database queries. Users can filter, group, join, and aggregate data efficiently using simple syntax, eliminating the need for complex procedural coding when handling large datasets.</p>


        <h2>Code Examples</h2>
        <h3>Creating a DataFrame</h3>
        <pre><code>import polars as pl

df = pl.DataFrame({
    "Name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"],
    "Age": [25, 30, 35],
    "Salary": [50000, 60000, 70000]
})

print(df)</code></pre>

        <h3>Filtering Data</h3>
        <pre><code>filtered_df = df.filter(pl.col("Age") > 28)
print(filtered_df)</code></pre>

        <h3>Grouping & Aggregating</h3>
        <pre><code>df.groupby("Age").agg(pl.col("Salary").sum())</code></pre>

        <h3>Reading & Writing Data</h3>
        <pre><code>df = pl.read_csv("data.csv")
df.write_parquet("output.parquet")</code></pre>

        <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <p>Polars is widely used in various domains:</p>
        <h3>1. Big Data Analytics</h3>
        <p>Polars is used to process vast amounts of data efficiently. It is ideal for applications such as customer segmentation, real-time event monitoring, and fraud detection.</p>

        <h3>2. Financial & Stock Market Analysis</h3>
        <p>Financial analysts and hedge funds use Polars for time-series analysis, portfolio optimization, and stock market predictions, benefiting from its low latency and fast computations.</p>

        <h3>3. Machine Learning & Data Preprocessing</h3>
        <p>Polars accelerates machine learning workflows by enabling rapid feature engineering, missing value imputation, and normalization, making it a valuable tool for data scientists.</p>

        <h3>4. Web Scraping & Data Extraction</h3>
